# **Technical Design Document: Birdspotting V2**

Version: 1.0  
Date: July 5, 2025  
Status: Initial Draft

## **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the technical architecture, tools, and standards for the Birdspotting V2 web application. It serves as a guide for the development team to ensure consistency, scalability, and maintainability.

## **2. Technology Stack**

The following technologies will be used to build the application:

### **2.1. Frontend**

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI (MUI)
  - A custom theme will be developed, featuring gradient styles to create a modern look and feel.
  - A responsive `AppBar` will be a core navigation component.
  - We will use icons from the Material Icons library.
- **State Management**: Primarily React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`). Custom hooks will be created to encapsulate and reuse business logic.

### **2.2. Backend (Firebase)**

- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication will be used, starting with Google Sign-in to provide a low-friction onboarding experience.
- **Database**: Cloud Firestore will serve as the primary NoSQL database for storing user data, sightings, and application state.
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting will be used to deploy and serve the static assets of the web application.
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics for Firebase will be integrated to track user engagement and application performance against the KPIs defined in the PRD.
- **Serverless Logic**: Cloud Functions for Firebase will be used for backend logic that should not run on the client, such as interacting with external APIs or performing intensive computations.
- **Machine Learning**: Google's Vertex AI will be leveraged for potential future machine learning features, such as bird identification from user-uploaded photos.

### **2.3. Development & Tooling**

- **Language**: TypeScript will be used across the entire frontend codebase for type safety and improved developer experience.
- **Node.js Version Management**: NVM (Node Version Manager) is recommended to ensure a consistent Node.js environment across the team.
- **Configuration**: Environment variables (`.env` files) will be used to manage configuration details like API keys and Firebase settings, separating them for different environments (development, production).
- **Development Server**: Vite's built-in development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) will be used for a fast and efficient development feedback loop.
